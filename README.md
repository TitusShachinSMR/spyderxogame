# SpyderXOGame

Welcome to the SpyderXOGame project! This is a common task for the Spider Club induction, where you'll implement a Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the game.

### Option 2: Manual Download

1. **Download Individual Files**
   - Make sure to download all three files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) into the same folder. For example, create a folder named `x-0` and download the following files into it:
     - `newtictactoe.html`
     - `newtictactoe.css`
     - `newtictactoe.js`
   
2. **Open the Folder in VS Code**
   - Open Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
   - Select "File" > "Open Folder" and choose the folder `x-0` where you saved the files.

3. **Run the Game**
   - Open the `newtictactoe.html` file in VS Code.
   - Right-click on the `newtictactoe.html` file and select "Open with Live Server" (ensure you have the Live Server extension installed in VS Code). Alternatively, you can open the `newtictactoe.html` file directly in your web browser.

## Files Description

- `newtictactoe.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `newtictactoe.css`: The CSS file that styles the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `newtictactoe.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic.

## Additional Tips

- Ensure all files are in the same directory to avoid any issues with file linking.
- If you encounter any issues, double-check the file paths and ensure that all files are correctly linked in the `newtictactoe.html` file.

Enjoy the game and have fun coding!
